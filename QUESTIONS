PROJECT 4 WRITE-UP
------------------

1) Briefly explain how you implemented comparison queries and how they affected your control block's signals (in a few sentences).

We represented the comparison register with a 2-bit value, 0 bit indicating if it was equal and the 1 bit indicating if it was less than/greater than.
If false it would be a No op, if true it sends in the signals from the instruction.

2) Please list your control block's control signals, and briefly explain what each one does (in a sentence or less each).

MEM_STR - indicates where you store in memory.
MEM_?LD - indicates where you load to memory.
RG_?WR - indicates where you write to register.
CR_? - whether you write to the comparison register.
PREP_JMP - indicates whether you jump to immediate or register value.

3) What features (if any) of this assembly language do you like?

We liked how the addresses were 24 bits, so you could jump immediately to another register. We also liked how it was case insensitive.

4) What features (if any) of this assembly language do you not like?

The comparison queries were a little unintuitive to us at first.
